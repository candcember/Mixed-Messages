# Mixed-Messages
CodeCademy Portfolio Project Mixed Messages

## Overview

The aim of this project was to create a random message generator that would be executed every time a user runs the program.

I decided to use three seperate groups of data, luck, strength (in reference to my pullup training) and finally finish on an inspirational quote.  

Each time the program is run, a random message is displayed summarising how lucky...or unlucky I will be today, how strong I will be and ending on an inspirational quote.
